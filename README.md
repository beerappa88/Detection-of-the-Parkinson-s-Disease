# Detection-of-the-Parkinson-s-Disease
machine learning project.
Parkinson's Disease Detection: This project utilizes a dataset to implement machine learning algorithms for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease. By analyzing key features from the dataset, such as tremor, bradykinesia, and other movement characteristics, the models aim to predict and diagnose the presence of Parkinson's. The project explores various classification techniques to assist in accurate and early identification, potentially aiding in proactive healthcare interventions.
